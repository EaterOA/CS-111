Because the specs are unclear on certain details, our shell makes the following
assumptions:
- A comment is equivalent to a newline (so A#\nB is parsed as A;B)
- A single newline in a subshell (after a simple command) is interpreted as
  a sequence
- Two newlines, which normally denotes the end of a complete command, is treated
  as an error when inside a subshell
- Additional redirects within a simple command will overwrite earlier ones
