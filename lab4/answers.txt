# EXERCISE 1: What method you used to make your peer download and upload files
# in parallel?  (~1-3 sentences)
In the start_download loop inside the main function, instead of starting each
download task right away, we store the tasks in a dynamic array of download
tasks. After processing all the filenames, we go through our task list and
fork child processes to download each task. The parent then waits on its
children until all the downloads are done.

For the uploads, we simply fork a process to execute task_upload everytime we
accept a task from task_listen.

# EXERCISE 2A: What conditions did you find and fix that would have triggered
# a buffer overrun bug?  (~1-3 sentences each)
In start_download and task_download, strcpy is called to copy the filename
arguments to the task filename buffer. This will overflow if the download
filenames are longer than 255 characters. We fixed it by using strncpy with a
limit of FILENAMESIZ-1.  You can find this in lines 519 and 577

Also, in task_upload, when a peer connects and sends a GET request, the
osp2p_snscanf used to parse the filename can overflow the task filename
buffer. To solve this, we first save the filename in a larger local buffer of
4096 bytes, check its length, and only store it in the 256-byte filename
buffer if it can fit.  You can find this in lines 701-706

# EXERCISE 2B: What other robustness problems did you fix?  (~1-3 sentences
# each)
We fixed the issue of peers being allowed to request files outside the current
directory.  We simply check the requested filename, and refuse the serve the
file if it contains a / character in it.  You can find this in lines 707-710

We fixed the issue of peers continuously sending us data and filling up our
disk space. To resolve this, inside task_download we check how much data we've
received so far. If we receive more than 10 MB, we treat that as an error,
delete the file, and try a different peer.  You can find this in lines 609-612

Another issue is that peers can connect and not say GET, hogging the socket
forever.  Once way to resolve this is to use the select() system call, which
can ensure that there will always be data that can be read from a file
descriptor. It can also time out if no data arrives, allowing the program to
terminate the connection. An implementation might look something like this:
while (1):
    status = select(socket, timeout)
    if (status == DATA):
        read(socket, data)
        process(data)
    else if (status == TIMEOUT):
        error("Timed out")
        close(socket)
The same issue goes from trying to download from a peer that doesn't send you
anything.  A select can be used to time out from uncooperative peers.

# EXERCISE 3: Describe the attacks you implemented for "evil mode".  Why are
# they attacks?  (~3-10 sentences each)
An uploader attack that we can do is, when a peer requests a file from us, we
instead open and send data from /dev/urandom. If the peer doesn't have a
filesize limit as discussed above, their disk space will be filled. An
implementation might look like:
if (evil_mode):
    fd = strcpy(filename, "/dev/urandom")
    while (1):
        read(fd, buf)
        write(socket, buf)

A downloader attack that we can do is to try requesting files with really long
names from peers. If the peer uses the skeleton code's filename buffer of 256
bytes, then GETting a 4000-byte filename will cause that peer to segfault. To
find peers to attack, simply ask the tracker for a list of who's registered:
if (evil_mode):
    write(tracker_socket, "WHO")
    read(response, tracker_socket)
    char longname[4000]
    memset(longname, 'A', 4000)
    for peer in response:
        peer_socket = connect(peer)
        write(peer_socket, "GET " + longname + " OSP2P") 

# Extra credit problems
Extra credit problem: File Integrity

The OSP2P trackers support an RPC called MD5SUM, which reports the base64 md5
digest of a given file. When peers register with the tracker and call HAVE,
they can optionally give an md5sum as another argument, letting the tracker
know the md5sum associated with a file. Peers who finish downloading a file
can check the integrity of their file by comparing its checksum to the one
reported by the tracker.  Of course, the tracker does not know whether the
md5sum that was given to it is legitimate or not, so doing this is still
risky. A malicious uploader can just as easily report the checksum of a
corrupted file and let people download it. So we still have to at least trust
the initial seeder.
